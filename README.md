# Checkers

So i feel like my checkers game has gotten to a point which i am satisfied with.  I have implemented the board, starting position, potential moves (green circles) and movement.

I was thinking about implementing a score board and other things like having multiple moves but i think that this would require a full rewrite from scratch which i am not up to doingright now.

As such I will leave the completion for this to another day
